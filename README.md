# Purchase Order System :page_facing_up:

### A purchase order is a legally binding document between a supplier and a buyer. This process is fully automated with multiple sub proceses playing an important role in it. These processes work in a system which is known as Purchase Order System.

* The system contains various sub-systems all connected via a MySQL server.
* Fully functional Mobile first UI.
* Simple and clean to work with.
* Added MySQL file for db import.
* Compatible with PhpMyAdmin(Obviously).

The project is not complete as this was a challenge to develop in one week but rest assured DB is working nonetheless.

## How to make it work?
All you need is a MAMP or a LAMP server XAMP can be used but it has it's own issues so windows users dont bother reading beyond this :satisfied:
* git clone the repo into local development server directory.
* Visit PhpMyAdmin and import the SQL file and check if DB is visible.
* If yes then awesome you're set.
* If not then trust me it works. 

> Code may not look good because haven't refactored it. Happy Coding!
